# Shopping-Cart Excercise
M.I.T. Full Stack Development - Shopping Cart Exercise
<br/>
This project taught us how to interact with the shopping in the following ways: </br>

1.)We can add a product to the cart<br/>
2.)It calculates the order total depending on what has been added to the cart <br/>
3.)We can remove the item by clicking the item in the cart, it will have an accordian drop and then if you click on the item within the accordian the item will be removed.<br/>
4.)Then you can remove all items with one click on using the "Restock" button option at the bottom.
